<Callout title="At a glance">
  **What:** A small portfolio template with projects + blog.

**Why:** To publish a CV site quickly with minimal customization.

**Result:** A clean, MDX-driven site you can deploy in minutes.

</Callout>

## Overview

Write 2–4 sentences explaining the project in plain language.

- What does it do?
- Who is it for?
- What makes it interesting?

## My role

A quick list is usually enough:

- Built the core pages and content pipeline
- Designed a minimal component set (shadcn/ui)
- Set up MDX content structure for posts and projects

---

## Problem → approach

### The problem

Describe the constraint in 1 paragraph (time, scope, performance, UX, etc.).

### The approach

Describe how you tackled it. Keep it concrete:

- Chose Next.js App Router for simple routing
- Used frontmatter + MDX for content
- Added a typed config so users update one file

---

## Technical highlights

Pick 2–4 bullets that show depth.

- **Content model:** frontmatter fields like `title`, `date`, `description`, `tags`.
- **Render pipeline:** `next-mdx-remote/rsc` + custom MDX components.
- **Safety:** slug validation + path traversal protection.

<Card title="Example snippet">

```ts
// A good “highlight” snippet shows something real and small.
// e.g. a typed config or helper used across the site.
export const siteConfig = {
  features: { blog: true, projects: true },
};
```

## Outcome

What changed because you built this?

- A measurable result (speed, adoption, users), **or**
- A clear before/after (complexity reduced, time saved), **or**
- A learning outcome (what you’d do differently next time)

---

## What I’d improve next

Keep it honest and short:

- Add project thumbnails
- Add a small “featured” flag to pin projects
- Generate a table of contents for longer writeups
