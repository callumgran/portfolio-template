<Callout title="TL;DR">
  This template shows a simple structure: a short intro, clear sections, and a
  few optional components to add emphasis without clutter.
</Callout>

<MdxImage
  src="/example.jpg"
  alt="Example inline image"
  caption="An example of an inline image placed anywhere in the post."
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>

## Why this format works

Good posts are usually:

- **scannable** (clear headings)
- **readable** (short paragraphs, consistent spacing)
- **resumable** (you can leave and continue without getting lost)

This template is designed to look good with Tailwind Typography (`prose`) and keep MDX components optional.

## The structure I recommend

Use this order most of the time:

1. **Hook** (1–3 paragraphs)
2. **Context** (what problem are we addressing?)
3. **Main points** (2–5 sections)
4. **Takeaways**
5. **Links / next steps**

## A small example section

Write short paragraphs. Prefer one idea per paragraph.

### Use lists for “shape”

- Start with the conclusion
- Add the why
- Add the details only if needed

### Include small emphasized moments

> If a paragraph feels long, it probably is.

---

## Takeaways

- Keep the intro short but specific.
- Use headings as “checkpoints”.
- Components should support the writing, not replace it.
